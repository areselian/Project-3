# Project-3

Group Members: Aliona Mizelle, Hannah Moy, Joao Costa, Vitor Ribeiro, & Michelle Fitzpatrick. 

We decided to do a deep-dive into data concerning NBA drafts, salaries, and colleges. We used two data sets: NBA Player Salaries - https://data.world/datadavis/nba-salaries & NBA Player Stats - https://www.kaggle.com/drgilermo/nba-players-stats. We used Google's Geo-coding API to get the coordinates of all the colleges, Python for data manipulation, cleaning and transformation, and used SQL to store our data. 
We used HTML/CSS, Javascript, D3, Leaflet, and Plotly to create dynamic and interactive data visualizations. 

Out of the requirements we omitted using flask. For this to fully work, we suggest using your own API KEY, as we've placed our config.js in a git ignore.
